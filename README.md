# NikonD40-camera-control

A Python script to control my Nikon D40 camera. Please note that I created this script very quickly for my own use, hence Quick and Dirty". It obtains values for aperture and shutter speed from the D40 and modifies these under GUI control. It has modes for single and multi photo sequences and it can automatically display each photo after it is downloaded to the computer. Interface with the camera is through gphoto2 commands via the bash shell. GUI is implemented with Tkinter.
